Project Scaffolding Sprint Workflow Analysis
Objective
Transform the metaprompt-aider.xml template to incorporate the Project Scaffolding Sprint Workflow Chain, integrating Aider's architect, code, and ask modes.

Current Implementation Status
Completed workflow mapping for 7 phases
Identified all commands and their corresponding Aider modes
Documented step-by-step progression with STOP points
Established clear phase transitions and mode requirements
Workflow Breakdown
Phase 1 - Vision Statement Generation
Mode: Architect Commands:

#generate-vision
#vision-status
[Steps and STOP points to be mapped]

Phase 2 - Initial Project Requirements Management
Mode: Architect Commands:

#generate-requirements
#requirements-status
[STEP 1] Project Idea Verification [STOP - Do not proceed until user replies with "ready"] [STEP 2] Project Idea Assessment [STOP - Wait for clarification then proceed to STEP 3] [STEP 3] Requirements Generation [STEP 4] Present requirements and ask for review [STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through revisions until approved] [STEP 5] After receiving approval [STOP - Wait for user's filename choice] [STOP - Do not proceed until user confirms they have switched to code mode] [STOP - Do not proceed until user confirms they are in ask mode]

Phase 3 - Technology Stack Generation
Mode: Architect Commands:

#generate-stack
#stack-status
[STEP 1] Requirements Verification [STOP - If requirements are missing, ask user to provide them] [STEP 2] Application Type Assessment [STOP - Wait for user response] [STEP 3] Core Technology Selection [STOP - Wait for user response] [STEP 4] Dependency Analysis [STOP - Wait for user response] [STEP 5] Generate Initial Stack [STOP - Wait for user response] [STEP 6] Compatibility Verification [STEP 7] Generate Documentation and Dependency Files [STEP 8] Present all documents [STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through revisions until approved] [STEP 9] After receiving approval [STOP - Wait for user to switch to code mode]

Phase 4 - Architecture Design Generation
Mode: Architect Commands:

#generate-architecture
#architecture-status
[STEP 1] Context Verification [STOP - If any items are missing, list them and wait for user to provide them] [STEP 2] Scope Confirmation [STOP - Wait for user confirmation] [STEP 3] Generate Core Architecture [STOP - Wait for user response] [STEP 4] Generate Documentation [STEP 5] Present complete design [STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through revisions until approved] [STEP 6] After receiving approval [STOP - Wait for user's filename choice] [STOP - Do not proceed until user confirms they have switched to code mode]

Phase 5 - Scaffolding Sprint Story Generation
Mode: Code Commands:

#generate-scaffold-stories
#scaffold-stories-status
[STEP 1] Check for essential items in context [STOP - If any items are missing, list them and wait for user to provide them] [STEP 2] Analyze Technical Foundation [STOP - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding] [STEP 3] Generate Core Scaffolding Stories [STEP 4] Present complete story set [STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through Step 4 until approved] [STEP 5] After receiving approval [STOP - Wait for user response about filename] [STOP - Wait for user to switch modes and request save]

Phase 6 - Story Analysis
Mode: Ask Commands:

#analyze-story S<X.Y>
#analysis-status
[STEP 1] Check for essential user story in context [STOP - If the story is missing, list it and wait for the user to provide it] [STEP 2] Present the story details [STOP - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding] [STEP 3] For each acceptance criterion, identify the required functionality [STEP 4] Generate ordered implementation steps [STEP 5] Present the implementation steps [STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through Step 5 until approved] [STEP 6] After receiving approval [STOP - Wait for user response about filename] [STOP - Wait for user to switch modes and request save]

Phase 7A - Implementation
Mode: Code Commands:

#implement-step S<X.Y> [step-number]
#implementation-status
[STEP 1] Check for essential items in context [STOP - If any items are missing, list them and wait for user to provide them] [STEP 2] Present the specific step to be implemented [STOP - Wait for user response] [STEP 3] Analyze requirements and create implementation plan [STOP - Wait for user review. Loop through revisions until approved] [STEP 4] After receiving 'approved' [STEP 5] After implementation is complete

Next Steps
Map Phase 1 (Vision Statement) steps and STOP points
Create XML template structure for each phase
Integrate Aider mode transitions into the workflow
Define input/output relationships between phases
Important Decisions Made
Organized workflow by Aider modes (Architect, Code, Ask)
Maintained strict STOP points for user verification
Established clear phase dependencies
Skipped unit testing phase for initial implementation
Outstanding Questions
Vision Statement phase steps and STOP points need mapping
Integration points between phases need detailed specification
Error handling and recovery procedures need definition
