# Metadata: Initial Project Requirements Management Prompt

## Description
A comprehensive requirements management prompt that implements a structured, command-driven workflow for gathering, documenting, and maintaining project requirements. The prompt enables systematic requirements generation and modification through a step-by-step process, ensuring requirements are clear, atomic, and traceable.

## AI Assistant Compatibility
- Tested With: 
  * Cursor with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Potential Compatible Assistants: 
  * Other Cursor versions
  * Other Claude models
  * GitHub Copilot (with modifications)
  * GPT-4 (with adaptations)

## SDLC Phase
- Phase: Planning
- Sub-Phase: Requirements Analysis
- Workflow: Initial Project Setup

## Complexity Rating
- Complexity: Medium
- Cognitive Load: Moderate
- Technical Depth: Requires understanding of requirements engineering principles

## Usage Guidelines
- Prerequisite: Project idea or problem statement
- Requires: 
  * Clear project vision
  * Basic project context
  * Understanding of target users
  * Desired feature set outline

## Prompt Characteristics
- Input Driven: Yes
- State Dependent: Yes
- Requires Contextual Awareness: Moderate
- Command Driven: Yes (#generate-requirements, #modify-requirements, #requirements-status)

## Best Practices
- Focus on explicit project needs
- Maintain clear requirement categorization
- Use consistent ID formatting
- Keep requirements atomic
- Avoid technical implementation details
- Mark assumptions clearly
- Support iterative refinement

## Potential Challenges
- Ambiguous project ideas
- Scope creep in requirements
- Maintaining requirement atomicity
- Managing requirement dependencies
- Balancing detail vs. clarity
- Avoiding implementation specifics

## Recommended Mitigation Strategies
- Structured requirement ID system
- Clear assumption marking
- Interactive refinement process
- Explicit user confirmation steps
- Complete requirement listing after changes
- Separate functional/additional requirements
- Maintain clear modification history
