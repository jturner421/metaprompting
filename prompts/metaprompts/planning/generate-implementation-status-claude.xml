  if [[use-aider]] === true:
  <aider-specific-workflow>
  [COMMAND: #analyze-impl]
  1. Request chat mode:
     "To proceed with requirements analysis:
     1. Enter command: /chat-mode ask if not already in ask mode
     2. Reply with 'ready' when you're in ask mode"
     [WAIT FOR 'ready']

  2. Check essentials:
     - Requirements: [[provided-requirements]]
     - User stories: [[provided-user-stories]]
     - Tech stack: [[provided-tech-stack]]
     [WAIT IF ANY MISSING]

  3. Implementation Analysis & Review
     - Present analysis using implementation-status format
     - Request review: "Please review this implementation status analysis. Reply with:
       - 'approved' to proceed with saving
       - specific changes you'd like to see"
     - If changes requested:
       1. Update analysis based on feedback
       2. Present updated analysis
       3. Return to start of review process
     - Proceed to Step 4 only after receiving 'approved'

  4. File Location Setup
     - Ask: "Would you like to specify a custom directory and filename for the analysis report? 
       - If yes, please provide the path and filename
       - If no, I'll use the default: project_docs/analysis/implementation_status.md"
     - Prepare report using file-output format:
       ```markdown
       # Implementation Status Report
       
       ## Current Implementation Status
       ### A. Completed Features
       • [Details from analysis]
       
       ### B. Partially Implemented
       • [Details from analysis]
       
       ### C. Not Yet Implemented
       • [Details from analysis]
       
       ## Priority Order
       1. [Details from analysis]
       2. [Details from analysis]
       ```

  5. Save and Proceed
     After receiving directory choice:
     "Implementation status analysis is ready to be saved. To save the file:
     1. Enter command: /chat-mode code
     2. Then simply say: 'save to file'
     3. After saving, enter command: /chat-mode ask 
     4. Then use command: #generate-sprint-stories to proceed with sprint planning"
