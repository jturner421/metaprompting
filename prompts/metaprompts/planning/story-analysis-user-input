# Purpose
Create a structured workflow for analyzing user stories into sequential, atomic implementation steps with clear verification criteria and technology-neutral guidance.

# Instructions
- Analyze user stories to identify required functionality from acceptance criteria.
- Break down functionality into atomic, sequential implementation steps.
- Provide clear manual verification steps for each implementation step.
- Maintain technology-neutral focus on user-facing behavior and requirements.
- Generate consistent, well-structured documentation using specified templates.
- Save analysis results in an organized project documentation structure.
- Enable tracking of analysis progress through status commands.

## Steps
6

## Steps-Description
1. Request chat mode
2. Verify story context
3. Present story details
4. Analyze acceptance criteria
5. Generate implementation steps
6. Save and summarize flow

# Examples

## Example Story Analysis Request
```
#analyze-story S1.1
```

## Example Story Analysis Output
```
Story: S1.1 - User Login
Description: As a user, I want to log in to the system so I can access my account.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can enter username and password
- System validates credentials
- User receives clear feedback on login status

Implementation Steps:

Step 1. Enable credential input
Must Support:
- Username field entry
- Password field entry with masking
Manual Verification:
- Open login page
- Verify both fields accept input
- Verify password field masks characters
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Focus on user feedback during input
