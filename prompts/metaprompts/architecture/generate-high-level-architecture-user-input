Purpose: Create the initial system architecture based on requirements and technology choices
Instructions:
    Based on the provided requirements and technology stack, generate a high-level architecture design.
    Include a clear component structure and relationships.
    Recommend architecture pattern based on requirements and tech stack.
    For each core component Map to system component, Assign technology from stack, define component responsibilities, andestablish component boundaries.
    Then design the component relationships that: define the data flow,    establish communication patterns,identify integration points, and map dependencies
    create a psuedo graph of of the layers and dependencies in a mermaid diagram.
