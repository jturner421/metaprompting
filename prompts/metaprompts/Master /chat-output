Proposed Changes for Metaprompt Architecture Integration
1. Initial System Design Enhancement
Added dedicated architectural review step
Implemented mode-switching validation
Created structured component analysis phase
2. Command Definitions Expansion
New architect-review command structure
Three-step architectural validation process
Clear mode transition points
3. Workflow Control Improvements
Two-phase approach: planning (ask mode) and execution (architect mode)
Explicit user approval requirements
Structured mode transitions with validation
4. Status Tracking Updates
Enhanced progress checklist
Mode-specific status tracking
Architectural decision monitoring
5. Mode Control Flow Addition
Pre-review phase in ask mode
Implementation phase in architect mode
User approval checkpoints
Key Benefits
Maintains user control over file changes
Leverages architect mode's strengths
Provides clear workflow visibility
Ensures systematic architectural validation
Let's proceed with implementing these changes in specific files based on your priorities.
