# Metadata: # Technology Stack Generation Prompt

## AI Assistant Compatibility
- Tested With: 
  * Cursor using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Potential Compatible Assistants: 
  * Other Claude models (untested)
  * Other Cursor versions (untested)

## SDLC Phase
- Phase: Planning
- Sub-Phase: Technology Selection
- Workflow: Initial Project Setup

## Complexity Rating
- Complexity: High
- Cognitive Load: High
- Technical Depth: Requires extensive knowledge of technology ecosystems and version compatibility

## Usage Guidelines
- Prerequisite: Project requirements list
- Requires: 
  * Existing dependency files (if any)
  * Application type understanding
