# Metadata: # Architecture Design Generator Prompt

## AI Assistant Compatibility
- Tested With: 
  * Cursor using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Potential Compatible Assistants: 
  * Other Claude models (untested)
  * Other Cursor versions (untested)

## SDLC Phase
- Phase: Design
- Sub-Phase: Initial Architecture
- Workflow: Project Scaffolding

## Complexity Rating
- Complexity: High
- Cognitive Load: High
- Technical Depth: Requires comprehensive understanding of architectural patterns and principles

## Usage Guidelines
- Prerequisite: Project requirements documentation
- Requires: 
  * Technology stack documentation
  * Core dependency definitions
  * Project scope understanding
  * Basic technical constraints
  * File paths for generated documentation
  * Node.js/npm for Mermaid diagram generation

## Prompt Characteristics
- Input Driven: Yes
- State Dependent: Yes
- Requires Contextual Awareness: High
- Command Driven: Yes (#generate-architecture, #architecture-status)
- Diagram Support: Mermaid.js integration
- User Path Control: Yes (requires user-specified file paths)

## Best Practices
- Focus on core structural decisions
- Minimize initial component count
- Document decision rationale
- Maintain clear component boundaries
- Use visual representations
- Keep documentation concise
- Limit scope to scaffolding needs

## Potential Challenges
- Scope creep beyond core architecture
- Over-engineering initial design
- Balancing flexibility vs. structure
- Managing technical constraints
- Maintaining documentation clarity
- Avoiding premature optimization

## Recommended Mitigation Strategies
- Strict scaffolding scope limits
- Core component focus
- Clear architectural boundaries
- Explicit decision documentation
- Visual diagram support
- Regular scope verification
- Minimal project structure depth

## Version
- Current Version: 2.0.0
- Last Updated: 2025-02-15
- Stability: Beta
